Angular CLI is a command-line tool, which works great when you want to serve an application or generate a simple component. But it falls short once you start doing advanced things.

- Exploring custom schematic collections is hard in the terminal, but it's easy using Angular Console.
- Using rarely-used flags is challenging. Do you pass absolute or relative paths? You don't have to remember any flags, names, or paths --â€ŠAngular Console will help you by providing autocompletion and validating your inputs.
- Finding the right Angular CLI extension can take a long time. When using Angular Console, you can find and install an extension in minutes.

#### Angular Console does more than that:

- It visualizes the results of a build or a test run.
- It visualizes how different projects in your workspace depend on each other.
- It shows dry run results as you create your command
- It shows remembers you most recent cli commands and saves their output for your reference

### [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin)

This extension displays linting errors and can also automatically fix them most of the time.

Linting rules help enforce coding standards and having this extension allows developers to easily align to coding standards before pushing code.

### [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

This extension automatically formats code consistently throughout the workspace.

Code Format is a major factor in code readibility and having it automated saves developer's time spent formatting, reviewing code, and reading code.
